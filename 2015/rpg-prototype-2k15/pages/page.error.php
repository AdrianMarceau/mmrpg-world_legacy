    <strong>Yikes!</strong>  Something has gone horribly wrong on the server and the prototype is completely down at the moment.
    Please hold tight while we look into the issue, and remember that this game is still in development and stuff happens occasionally.
    If this page has been here for a long time, it <em>probably</em> means the issue is serious and may require extra time to fix.
    In events of extended downtime you should <a href="http://facebook.com/megamanrpgprototype/" target="_blank">check the Facebook page</a> for updates.
    Thank you for playing and you we're sorry for the inconvenience.
