Being a Mega Man fan-game, this project obviously owes most of it\'s thanks to Capcom and of course, Keiji Inafune. The Mega Man RPG Prototype is a browser-based fangame that combines the mechanics of both the PokÃ©mon and Mega Man series of video games into one strange and wonderful little time waster.';
