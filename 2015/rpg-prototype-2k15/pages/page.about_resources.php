Being a Mega Man fan-game, this project obviously owes most of it\'s thanks to Capcom and of course, Keiji Inafune. The Mega Man RPG Prototype is a browser-based fangame that combines the mechanics of both the PokÃ©mon and Mega Man series of video games into one strange and wonderful little time waster.';

    Many (and maybe all) sprites that appear in this game were found on the number one Mega Man sprite resource - Sprites Inc. - and without the the website I'm sure many Mega Man fan-games would not have been possible.  Even the custom sprites are based on those found on this website, and I cannot thank the creators and contributors enough for their efforts and the fantastic service they provide.  I highly recommend the website for all your Mega Man sprite needs.  :)

    The Mega Man Knowledge Base is used as a constant reference for robot weaknesses, official names, artwork, quotes, and so much more.  This is one of the best resources on the internet for official Mega Man data and without it this game would not have been possible.  Thank you, Mega Man community, for this incredibly useful resource.  :D

    Almost MP3 tracks were converted to Firefox-compatible OGG files using this tool, and it has been incredibly helpful in easing the pain of cross-browser support.  Their online audio conversion is very simple to use and is completely free.  I am so happy that this tool exists and recommend it to anyone interested in HTML game development.

    Another tool I used for converting MP3 files is the audio section of the online-convert.com website.  Much like media.io, this tool allows one to convert MP3s and other file formats to the Firefox-required OGG as well as a whole plethora of other formats.  I really like the amount of options offered and the amount detail-tweaking allowed on this website.
